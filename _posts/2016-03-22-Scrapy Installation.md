The installation for scrapy is not easy， just remind：

Pre-requisites:

1.   lxml. Most Linux distributions ships prepackaged versions of lxml. Otherwise refer to http://lxml.de/installation.html

2.   OpenSSL. This comes preinstalled in all operating systems except Windows (see Platform specific installation notes)

The lxml and openSSL is necessary for windows platform too.
